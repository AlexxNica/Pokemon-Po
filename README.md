# Pokemon Po
A D3.js visualization of our naive algorithm and improved algorithm for catching Pokemon proposed for the 2016 Brown Mathematical Contest for Modeling. 
Choose an initial starting location and speed, decide which optimization strategy to employ, and then press start to visualize both algorithms. A counter for the number of pokemon caught and total points gained is on the right. This visualization runs 36 times the real speed.
